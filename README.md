# OO Person Lab

## Learning Goals

- Gain proficiency instantiating a class

## Introduction

To practice object oriented programming (OOP), you're going to create a `Person` class. Each instance of the class will have the ability to:

- Get paid/receive payments
- Take a bath
- Call a friend
- Start a conversation
- State if they are happy and/or clean

## Instructions

Create a `Person` class with the behavior described below. You may need to configure some attributes as properties with custom setter and/or getter methods.

- `Person(name)`: takes a string argument of a name and saves it to the instantiated object. You should indicate that the name property should be treated as private after initialization and shoud not be changed. When a new person is instantiated, they should have the following attributes in addition to their name (saved as instance attributes on initialization):

    - `Person bank_account` with an initial value of 25
    - `Person happines` with an initial value of 8
    - `Person hygiene` with an initial value of 8
